        <p class="content">Round base trading competition with fistfights and
        leverage.</p> <p class="content">Each round players must survive head to
        head battles known as fistfights. Players decide if and when to initiate
        a fistfight. This decision must happen before the middle of the
        round.</p>

        <p class="content">Winners of each fistgiht move on to the next round,
        losers are knocked out of the league. In addition to survival, winners
        will receive one block which they can use in a future round of their
        choice. When a player actives a block, he or she is shielded from
        participating in a fistfight. This shield expires at the end of the
        round.</p>

        <p class="content">A player’s round performance is determined by
        percentage change of their portfolio from the beginning of the round
        compared to the end of the round. Leverage points are not considered in
        round performance. For example, let's suppose player A1 and player B1
        are in a fistfight. If A1 increases his portfolio by 10% and B1
        increases his portfolio by 9%, A1 moves on to the next round and B1 is
        knocked out of the league.  Each round is independent from the rest.</p>

      <h3 class="title is-6">What is the leverage? </h3>
      <p class="content">
        By leveraging, you
        make a bet on your entire portfolio. At the end of the bet, you will
        either receive a leverage bonus for a correct prediction or a leverage
        penalty for an incorrect prediction.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        <h3 class="title is-6">What is the bet? </h3>
        <ol>
          <li class="content">Your portfolio will increase in value before the
            league ends.
          </li>
          <li class="content">Your portfolio will not fall to or below the
            liquidation point.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="content">The system liquidates accounts every 30 minutes . So
      if this does occur, you may receive a tiny grace period to improve
      your portfolio. If by the end of the grace period the value of
      your portfolio is at or below the liquidation point, you will be
      knocked out of the league.</p>
      <p class="content">
        <h3 class="title is-6">When does the bet end? </h3>

        <p class="content">The bet ends if any of the following scenarios
        occur:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You click the deleverage button located within the league’s
            homepage
          </li>
          <li>
            Your portfolio falls to or below the liquidation point AND
            it stays at or below the liquidation point beyond the grace period.
          </li>
          <li>
            The current round ends
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        <h3 class="title is-6">How is the penalty/bonus calculated?</h3>
        At the start of the bet the current value of your portfolio will be
        used to generate a baseline value. At the end of the bet, the current
        value of your portfolio will be used to generate a post value. The
        percentage difference will be used to calculate your bonus/penalty.
        View the chart below for examples.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        <h3 class="title is-6">How is the liquidation point calculated? </h3>

        At the start of the bet the current value of your portfolio will be used
        to gather a baseline. This baseline and the leverage type will determine
        the liquidation point. See the table below for the general liquidation
        trigger points. The calculator will provide precise liquidation trigger
        points based on the current value of your portfolio.
